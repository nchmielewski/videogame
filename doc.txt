Rough Videogame Design

hello, here i will design my videogame

it's a DnD style adventure game, roll die for outcomes
completely text based, played in Command Prompt
centered around survival and turn based combat

adventure lands, collect loot, defeat foes

there will be a number of cycles:
sun/moon
	- sun rise and set
	- moon rise and set
	- moon phases
calendar year
	- every irl second is a minute
	- every irl minute is an hour
weather
	- rain, sun, snow, fog, thunder, wind
	- clouds
nature
	- animal sleep cycles
	- ambient sound
health
	- food and water
	- injuries

there will be a number of locations:
forest of the talking trees
forest of spiders
forest of the undead

there should be a core engine that other features read from
clock based on seconds, count values over time (have caution for type overflow)
